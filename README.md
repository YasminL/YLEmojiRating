# YLEmojiRating

Use YLEmojiRating to improve your Appstore rating (with a fun twist!). 

## How it works
YLEmojiRating shows a view where the users rates the app in emojis. The emojis üò±üò® and üòê represents 1-3 stars and will redirect the user to the mail client to leave feedback. The emojis üôÇ and üòÄ will redirect the user to Appstore to leave a review.
